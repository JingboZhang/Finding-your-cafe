Finding your cafe is a R shiny application based on a data set named ‘DDOT Sidewalk Cafe Inspections’ downloaded from open data DC. 

The application consists of two parts: requirement selection and visualization. On the left side of this application, user can select his target location, including quadrant and neighborhood, and personal requirement. After selection, user can get result on the right part. The map will show the detailed location of coffee shops that satisfy user’s requirement. The application is interactive from two aspects. First, the center of map will change to the neighborhood user choose by clicking on action buttons. Second, based on the selection, the application will make a subset of the original data set. Only coffee shops that satisfy user’s requirement will appear on the map and those do not satisfy user’s requirement will be removed automatically. In addition, user can get detailed information of the coffee shop he is interested in by clicking on the icon in map directly.
